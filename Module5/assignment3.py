#   1. People probably don't go into work
#   2. They probably sleep in late on Saturday
#   3. They probably run a bunch of random errands, since they couldn't during the week
#   4. They should be home, at least during the very late hours, e.g. 1-4 AM
#
# On Weekdays:
#   1. People probably are at work during normal working hours
#   2. They probably are at home in the early morning and during the late night
#   3. They probably spend time commuting between work and home everyday

# TODO: The idea is that the call was placed before 5pm. From Midnight-730a, the user is
# probably sleeping and won't call / wake up to take a call. There should be a brief time
# in the morning during their commute to work, then they'll spend the entire day at work.

# INFO: Run K-Means with K=3 or K=4. There really should only be a two areas of concentration. If you
# notice multiple areas that are "hot" (multiple areas the usr spends a lot of time at that are FAR
# apart from one another), then increase K=5, with the goal being that all centroids except two will
# sweep up the annoying outliers and not-home, not-work travel occasions. the other two will zero in
# on the user's approximate home location and work locations. Or rather the location of the cell
# tower closest to them.....

# samples attached to it. If our logic is correct, the cluster with the MOST samples will be work.
# The cluster with the 2nd most samples will be home. And the K=3 cluster with the least samples
# should be somewhere in between the two. What time, on average, is the user in between home and
# work, between the midnight and 5pm?
