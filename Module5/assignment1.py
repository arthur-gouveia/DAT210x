# 1. Navigate to: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2
# 2. In the 'Primary Type' column, click on the 'Menu' button next to the info button,
#    and select 'Filter This Column'. It might take a second for the filter option to
#    show up, since it has to load the entire list first.
# 3. Scroll down to 'GAMBLING'
# 4. Click the light blue 'Export' button next to the 'Filter' button, and select 'Download As CSV'
